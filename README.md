# November 2015 Release Updates
- **Splash Screen:**  Add a configurable splash screen and specify custom title and contents.
- **LayerList:**  The layer list widget has been updated to add support for displaying legend info and setting layer opacity.

# July 2015 Release Updates
- **Optional Subtitle:** Added support for specifying a subtitle. To specify subtitle text update config/defaults.js and specify the subtitle text using the subtitle property.
-  **Custom URL Parameters:** The template now supports the ability to define a custom url parameter along with the search layer and field. This can be used to build applications that display a particular feature at application startup. For example if your app displays parcel features you could define a custom url parameter called parcel and then users can navigate there directly by appending ?parcel=1245243242343 and the map will zoom to that feature on startup. Define these values using by setting the customUrlParam and customUrlLayer properties in config/defaults.js.
-  **Support for toggling sub layers:** The layers feature now allows you to toggle the visibility of sub layers.
-  **Define custom print layout title:** The print feature now provides an option for users to define a custom title for the print layout.
-  **Reduce white space on panels:** Reduced white space on panels. Now the panels (Legend, layer, desc etc) size to fit the content.

# Instructions

## Local setup

1. Download and unzip the .zip file or clone the repository.
2. Web-enable the directory.
3. Access the .html page.
4. Start writing your template!

## Deploying

1. To deploy this application, download the template from Portal/ArcGIS Online and unzip it.
2. Copy the unzipped folder containing the web app template files, such as index.html, to your web server. You can rename the folder to change the URL through which users will access the application. By default the URL to the app will be `http://<Your Web Server>/<app folder name>/index.html`
3. Change the sharing host, found in defaults.js inside the config folder for the application, to the sharing URL for ArcGIS Online or Portal. For ArcGIS Online users, keep the default value of www.arcgis.com or specify the name of your organization.
  - ArcGIS Online Example:  `"sharinghost": location.protocol + "//" + “<your organization name>.maps.arcgis.com`
  - Portal Example where `arcgis` is the name of the Web Adaptor: `"sharinghost": location.protocol + "//" + "webadaptor.domain.com/arcgis"`
4. If you are using Portal or a local install of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, change all references to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in index.html to refer to your local copy of the API. Search for the references containing `"//js.arcgis.com/3.13"` and replace this portion of the reference with the url to your local install.
  - For example: `"//webadaptor.domain.com/arcgis/jsapi/jsapi"` where `arcgis` is the name of your Web Adaptor.
5. Copy a map or group ID from Portal/ArcGIS Online and replace the default web map ID in the application’s default.js file. You can now run the application on your web server or customize the application further.

**Note:** If your application edits features in a feature service, contains secure services or web maps that aren't shared publicly, or generate requests that exceed 200 characters, you may need to set up and use a proxy page. Common situations where you may exceed the URL length are using complex polygons as input to a task or specifying a spatial reference using well-known text (WKT). For details on installing and configuring a proxy page see [Using the proxy](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html). If you do not have an Internet connection, you will need to access and deploy the ArcGIS API for JavaScript documentation from [developers.arcgis.com](https://developers.arcgis.com/).
